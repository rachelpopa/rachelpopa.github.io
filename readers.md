      <p>Love your article. Now it makes me want to go back to Prague, and have a room that faces the sunset looking at the Cathedral. Yes, so magical! But before I do that, perhaps I'll make some of that blueberry moonshine! Wouldn't that go over huge here in Newfoundland?!! Congratulations to all of you for opening up your new Zine!</p>

      <p>Can’t wait to read the next excerpt of ‘Donny in the dark’. Brilliant way to present in a ‘zine’ so we have to check it out monthly!</p>
