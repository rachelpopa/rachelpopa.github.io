        <h2 class="bio-title" >Megan Nygrych, Editor in Chief</h2>
        <p>Megan obtained her B.A. in Japanese language with a minor in History in 2012, paired with a BA in Theatre Arts. She continued on and was awarded her MA in History in 2014 from the University of Regina.

        <p>When she is not nose deep in a book about one of these topics, she can be found buried under a stack of comic books, fantasy novels, and horror media. She is passionate about creative writing and poetry, with a focus on horror and short fiction. Between stories she can be found slaying monsters in video games, and causing chaos playing Shadowrun and Dungeons &amp; Dragons. She has a knack for trivia and memorizing facts and information, which is the ace up her sleeve to keep conversations from becoming too boring or predictable.</p>
        <p>She has been published in The Japanese Encyclopedia of Horror Films (Rowman &amp; Littlefield 2016), and sporatally maintains on online presence through her blog, containing both creative writing and more academically tilted articles.</p>

        <h2 class="bio-title">Ariadne Bissett, Associate Editor</h2>
        <p>Ariadne hails from sunny Regina Saskatchewan. During her misspent youth she’s lived in Winnipeg Manitoba, and Trier Germany, but can’t say she’s still fluent in the language of either. She's currently a stay at home Mom, is formerly a civil servant, but has mostly been a student, eventually earning a bachelor’s degree in Anthropology at the University of Regina with a Minor in History.  Ariadne’s blinding passions include her longtime membership in Regina’s Halcyon Chamber Choir. She has been involved with Halcyon off and on since her high school days, (which makes her an OT VII level member at least). She also loves musical theatre to an embarrassing degree. If one were to hum the opening lines to any number from Wicked in her presence, there would be a full musical situation within minutes.  She likes writing science fiction, and binging science fiction pop culture. Recently Ariadne has gotten into making and researching her own probiotic foods, and is interested in writing about the history of fermentation. Her kitchen-speriments may make an appearance in future issues, if she survives... </p>
