She is passionate about creative writing and poetry, with a focus on horror and short fiction. Between stories she can be found slaying monsters in video games, and causing chaos playing Shadowrun and Dungeons &amp; Dragons. She has a knack for trivia and memorizing facts and information, which is the ace up her sleeve to keep conversations from becoming too boring or predictable.</p>

        <h2 class="bio-title">Ariadne Bissett, Associate Editor</h2>
        <p>Ariadne hails from sunny Regina Saskatchewan. During her misspent youth she’s lived in Winnipeg Manitoba, and Trier Germany, but can’t say she’s still fluent in the language of either. She's currently a stay at home Mom, is formerly a civil servant, but has mostly been a student, eventually earning a bachelor’s degree in Anthropology at the University of Regina with a Minor in History.  Ariadne’s blinding passions include her longtime membership in Regina’s Halcyon Chamber Choir. She has been involved with Halcyon off and on since her high school days, (which makes her an OT VII level member at least). She also loves musical theatre to an embarrassing degree. If one were to hum the opening lines to any number from Wicked in her presence, there would be a full musical situation within minutes.  She likes writing science fiction, and binging science fiction pop culture. Recently Ariadne has gotten into making and researching her own probiotic foods, and is interested in writing about the history of fermentation. Her kitchen-speriments may make an appearance in future issues, if she survives... </p>

        <h2 class="bio-title">Jocelyn Anderson, Art Director</h2>
        <p>Jocelyn Anderson has always been interested in the arts. Whether it was visual arts, theatre, or music, if there was an opportunity to get creative she was in. After finishing her Bachelor of Music with a concentration in Trumpet at McGill University, she moved back home to Saskatchewan to figure out exactly what a job in the arts might look like. After some searching, she settled on Arts and Culture non-profit administration so she could help bring programing to as many people as possible and she currently works as an office assistant at Theatre Saskatchewan.</p>
        <p>On top of her work to make sure everyone can enjoy the arts, Jocelyn has been known to enjoy making some art herself. She has been known to paint the ocasional picture (or draw… it depends on her mood), get up on stage and sing for theatrical productions, help paint and construct sets for said theatre productions and do all sorts of crafty things. She is also a huge book-worm and tabletop gamer, playing games like Dungeons and Dragons, Edge of Empire (Star Wars RPG) and stacks of games she has kickstarted with themes ranging from superheroes to alien invasion to pirates.</p>
        <p>Jocelyn also finds herself learning quite a bit about hunting and fishing and snowmobiling and other outdoorsy endeavours from her husband and his friends, who call themselves Team Junk. At times she feels like a geeky ambassador to the land of the outdoorsman and is interested in writing about both her artsy and geeky pursuits and about the adventures of Team Junk.</p>
