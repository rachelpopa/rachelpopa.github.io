        <p>Megan Negrych obtained her B.A. in Japanese language with a minor in History in 2012, paired with a BA in Theatre Arts. She continued on and was awarded her MA in History in 2014 from the University of Regina. Her research interests include: Shakespeare and adaptation; memory, trauma, and the legacy of the war in Japan; myth and folklore; and the social and cultural history of horror in Japanese pop culture.</p>
        <p>When she is not nose deep in a book about one of these topics, she can be found buried under a stack of comic books, fantasy novels, and horror media. She is passionate about creative writing and poetry, with a focus on horror and short fiction. Between stories she can be found slaying monsters in video games, and causing chaos playing tabletop roleplaying games like Shadowrun and Dungeons &amp; Dragons. She has a knack for trivia and memorizing facts and information, which is the ace up her sleeve to keep conversations from becoming too boring or predictable.</p>
        <p>With Deja-Visite, Megan hopes to share her passion and knowledge about history, including cultural history, horror history, legends, and myths in a thoughtful, engaging, and informative way. She also plans to explore various facets of creative writing, including forays into serial fiction, poetry, horror, and stream-of-consciousness reflection..</p>
        <p>She has been published in The Japanese Encyclopedia of Horror Films (Rowman &amp; Littlefield 2016), and sporadically maintains an online presence through her blog, containing both creative writing and more academically tilted articles (<a class="bio-link" href="https://mllemacabre.wordpress.com">mllemacabre.wordpress.com</a>).</p>

        <p>Ariadne Bissett hails from sunny Regina, Saskatchewan. During her misspent youth she lived in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and Trier, Germany, but can’t say that she is still fluent in the language of either. She is currently a stay-at-home mom, is formerly a civil servant, but has mostly been a student. She  earned her bachelor’s degree in Anthropology with a Minor in History at the University of Regina.  Ariadne’s blinding passions include her longtime membership in Regina’s Halcyon Chamber Choir. She has been involved with Halcyon off and on since her high school days, (which makes her an OT VII level member at least). She also loves musical theatre to an embarrassing degree. If one were to hum the opening lines to any number from Wicked in her presence, there would be a full musical situation within minutes.  She likes writing science fiction, and binging science fiction pop culture. Recently Ariadne has gotten into making and researching her own probiotic foods, and is interested in writing about the history of fermentation. Her kitchen-speriments may make an appearance in future issues, if she survives... </p>

        <p>Jocelyn Anderson has always been interested in the arts. Whether it was visual arts, theatre, or music, if there was an opportunity to do something creative Jocelyn was there trying it out. After finishing her Bachelor of Music, with a concentration in Trumpet at McGill University, Jocelyn moved back home to Saskatchewan to figure out exactly what a job in the arts might look like. After some searching, she settled on Arts and Culture non-profit administration so she could help bring arts programing to as many people as possible. She currently works as an office assistant for Theatre Saskatchewan Inc.</p>
        <p>While working hard to make sure everyone can enjoy the arts, Jocelyn has been known to enjoy making some art herself. On occasion she paints, draws, gets up on stage to sing for theatrical productions, and does all sorts of other crafty things. She is a member of The CTK Players and helps them with their set design and construction. She is also a huge bookworm and tabletop gamer. She plays games like Dungeons and Dragons, Edge of Empire (a Star Wars RPG) and has stacks of games she has kickstarted.</p>
        <p>Jocelyn also finds herself learning quite a bit about hunting, fishing, snowmobiling, and other outdoorsy endeavours from her husband and his friends, who call themselves Team Junk. At times she feels like a geeky ambassador to the land of the outdoorsman and is interested in writing about both her artsy and geeky pursuits and about the adventures of Team Junk.</p>

        <p>Victoria Koops is an emerging writer living in Southeast Saskatchewan, Canada. She primarily writes Young Adult fiction, dealing with all things nerdy and geeky. Her latest work-in-progress, <i>In Real Life</i>, is a coming of age story about two teenagers finding their place in the world through Role Playing Games (RPGs), but beneath themes of gaming, identity, and self-discovery, the reader is also led to explore major societal issues like homophobia, sexuality, and family.</p>
        <p>When Victoria isn't writing about nerd life, she's out there living it. She loves all things Bioware, Star Wars, Tolkien, and Harry Potter. She's also a fan of gardening, honeybees, and of course, a good book.</p>
        <p>Victoria is excited to be striking out with the Deja-Visite team and hopes to expand her writing to include magazine articles and meaningful prairie short stories.
